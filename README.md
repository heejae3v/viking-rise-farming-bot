The bot recognizes the farm and moves by recognizing preset coordinates or buttons.    
It is optimized that my environment. (army unit, language, display resolution etc ...)

# Runs
 
     top20_바이킹V3.py
     screeninfo_V3.py

I recommended change Viking rise Language settings to Korean. (It will be easier than change imgs)
 
# Requirements

- python 3.6 +
- pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)
- bluestacks or likewise
- qhd display (2560 x 1600) Perhaps, you can run this bot to change coordinate that optimized by your display resolution.
